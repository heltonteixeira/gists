## Current Issues

No known issues at the moment. All previously reported issues have been addressed.

## Next Steps

1. Review the claudeDev_docs\sprintDocs\02_frontendStructure.md file and identify any missing tasks or improvements needed in the frontend structure.

2. Implement any missing features or improvements identified in the 02_frontendStructure.md file.

3. Continue with the previously identified tasks:
   - Debug and resolve the "Unhandled error during execution of setup function" in ExplorerPage
   - Fix the "watch is not defined" error in ExplorerPage.vue
   - Investigate and resolve the "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'component')" error
   - Address the performance issues with slow click handlers

4. Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback:
   - Add toast notifications or alert components for success/error messages for CRUD operations
   - Ensure all user actions provide appropriate feedback

5. Add loading indicators for asynchronous operations:
   - Implement loading states during authentication
   - Show loading indicators when saving or fetching prompts

6. Refine the UI/UX:
   - Review and adjust the layout of pages and components to ensure they follow the guidelines in wireframes.csv and the files in the wireframes folder
   - Improve overall user experience based on the implemented features

7. Expand unit testing:
   - Add more unit tests for components, especially ExplorerPage and ManagementArea
   - Implement integration tests for critical user flows (e.g., authentication, CRUD operations)

8. Optimize performance:
   - Review and optimize the search and filter functionality in the Explorer Page
   - Investigate and optimize slow click handlers

9. Security enhancements:
   - Review the current authentication method and consider implementing a more secure solution for production use

10. Documentation:
    - Update the README.md file with information about the project setup, available scripts, and how to run tests
    - Ensure all code is properly commented for better maintainability

## Opening Message for Next Session

In the next session, we will focus on reviewing the claudeDev_docs\sprintDocs\02_frontendStructure.md file to identify any missing tasks or improvements needed in the frontend structure. We will then proceed to implement these missing features or improvements.

Please review the current frontend structure and be prepared to discuss any areas that need attention or enhancement based on the guidelines in the 02_frontendStructure.md file.

## Recent Changes

1. Updated PromptForm component to fix tags field validation:
   - Implemented a new validation rule for tags that only checks for empty tags
   - Updated the isTagsValid computed property to ensure at least one non-empty tag is present
   - Modified the isFormValid computed property to check for title, content, and valid tags
   - Disabled the submit button when the form is not valid
   - Updated the submitForm function to check both form validation and tag validity before submitting

2. Updated ManagementArea component:
   - Ensured proper handling of form submission and validation

3. Verified that the changes resolved the following issues:
   - The error message for empty tags only appears when trying to add an empty tag
   - The submit button is disabled when the form is invalid (missing title, content, or no valid tags)
   - The form can be submitted when all required fields are filled, including at least one non-empty tag

## User Feedback

Make sure to continue following the layout guidelines in the wireframes.csv and the files in the wireframes folder for any future UI/UX improvements.
