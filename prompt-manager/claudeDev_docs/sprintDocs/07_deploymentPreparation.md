# Sprint 7: Deployment Preparation

## Objectives

- Prepare the application for production deployment
- Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
- Conduct final testing and optimization
- Create documentation for deployment and maintenance

## Tasks

### 1. Production Build Configuration

1. Set up environment-specific configuration files
2. Optimize build process for production (minification, tree-shaking, etc.)
3. Implement proper error logging and monitoring for production

### 2. Set Up CI/CD Pipeline

1. Choose a CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
2. Configure automated testing in the CI pipeline
3. Set up automated deployment to staging and production environments

### 3. Server Setup and Configuration

1. Set up production server environment (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean, Heroku)
2. Configure server security settings (firewall, SSL, etc.)
3. Set up a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) if necessary

### 4. Database Setup for Production

1. Set up production database instance
2. Configure database backups and recovery procedures
3. Implement database migration scripts for future updates

### 5. Final Testing and Optimization

1. Conduct load testing and optimize for scalability
2. Perform final security audit and penetration testing
3. Optimize assets for fast loading (image compression, CDN setup, etc.)

### 6. Monitoring and Logging

1. Set up application performance monitoring (e.g., New Relic, Datadog)
2. Implement centralized logging system
3. Set up alerts for critical errors and performance issues

### 7. Documentation

1. Create deployment documentation for future reference
2. Document server setup and configuration
3. Create a runbook for common maintenance tasks and troubleshooting

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Production build is optimized and properly configured
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline is set up and functioning correctly
- [ ] Production server environment is secure and properly configured
- [ ] Database is set up for production with proper backup procedures
- [ ] Final testing is complete with no critical issues
- [ ] Monitoring and logging systems are in place
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation is created for deployment and maintenance

## Next Steps

With the completion of this sprint, the application should be ready for production deployment. The next steps would involve:

1. Conducting a final review of all systems and documentation
2. Performing a staged rollout to production
3. Monitoring the application closely after deployment
4. Gathering user feedback and planning for future updates and improvements
