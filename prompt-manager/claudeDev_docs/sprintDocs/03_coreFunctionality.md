# Sprint 3: Core Functionality

## Objectives

- Implement CRUD operations for prompts
- Set up local storage for data persistence
- Implement collections and tagging functionality
- Enhance user experience with improved form handling and theme switching

## Tasks

### 1. Implement Create Functionality

1. Update `PromptForm.vue` to handle prompt creation
2. Add form validation for required fields
3. Implement Pinia action for creating new prompts

### 2. Implement Read Functionality

1. Update `PromptList.vue` to display all prompts
2. Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for large numbers of prompts
3. Create a detailed view component for individual prompts

### 3. Implement Update Functionality

1. Add edit functionality to `PromptCard.vue`
2. Update `PromptForm.vue` to handle prompt editing
3. Implement Pinia action for updating existing prompts

### 4. Implement Delete Functionality

1. Add delete button to `PromptCard.vue`
2. Implement confirmation dialog before deleting
3. Implement Pinia action for deleting prompts

### 5. Set Up Local Storage

1. Implement a service for interacting with local storage
2. Update Pinia store to use local storage for data persistence
3. Implement error handling for local storage operations

### 6. Implement Collections

1. Create a new component for managing collections
2. Update `PromptForm.vue` to allow assigning prompts to collections
3. Implement filtering by collection in the Explorer Page

### 7. Implement Tagging

1. Update `PromptForm.vue` to allow adding tags to prompts
2. Implement a tag input component with autocomplete
3. Add tag-based filtering and searching in the Explorer Page

### 8. Enhance User Experience

1. Implement theme switching functionality with light and dark modes
2. Add icons to improve visual cues for user actions
3. Improve form handling in `PromptForm.vue`:
   - Implement watchers to update form data when props change
   - Add logic to reset the form after submitting a new prompt
   - Improve handling of editing existing prompts
4. Add autocomplete attribute to password fields for better security and user experience

## Completion Criteria

- [x] CRUD operations for prompts are fully implemented
- [x] Data is persisted using local storage
- [ ] Collections can be created and prompts can be assigned to them
- [x] Tagging system is implemented with search and filter functionality
- [ ] All operations have proper error handling and user feedback
- [x] Theme switching is implemented and persists between page reloads
- [x] Forms handle prop changes and resets correctly
- [x] Password fields have appropriate autocomplete attributes

## Next Steps

1. Implement error handling and success messages for CRUD operations
2. Add loading indicators for asynchronous operations
3. Implement pagination for the Explorer Page
4. Conduct comprehensive testing of all features
5. Refine the UI/UX based on user feedback
6. Consider implementing a more secure authentication method for production use

Once these tasks are completed, proceed to `04_backendSetup.md` to begin setting up the backend infrastructure for the application.
