# Sprint 1: Project Setup

## Objectives

- Set up the development environment
- Initialize the Vue.js project with Vite
- Configure essential dependencies and tools

## Tasks

### 1. Environment Setup

1. [x] Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed)
2. [x] Install Vue CLI globally: `npm install -g @vue/cli`

### 2. Project Initialization

1. [x] Create a new Vue 3 project with Vite:

   ```shell
   npm init vite@latest prompt-manager -- --template vue
   cd prompt-manager
   ```

2. [x] Install project dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

### 3. Install and Configure Additional Dependencies

1. [x] Install Vuetify:

   ```shell
   npm install vuetify
   ```

2. [x] Install Pinia for state management:

   ```shell
   npm install pinia
   ```

3. [x] Install Vue Router:

   ```shell
   npm install vue-router@4
   ```

### 4. Set Up Project Structure

1. [x] Create necessary directories:
   - `src/views`
   - `src/components`
   - `src/store`
   - `src/assets`

2. [x] Set up basic routing in `src/router/index.js`
3. [x] Set up Pinia store in `src/store/index.js`

### 5. Configure Development Tools

1. [x] Install and configure ESLint:

   ```shell
   npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-plugin-vue
   ```

2. [x] Install and configure Prettier:

   ```shell
   npm install --save-dev prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier
   ```

### 6. Create Basic App Structure

1. [x] Update `src/App.vue` with a basic layout
2. [x] Create placeholder components for Home and Management views

### 7. Additional Tasks

1. [x] Set up Vuetify in main.js
2. [x] Create a basic Home view with prompt management functionality
3. [x] Implement a simple Pinia store for managing prompts

## Completion Criteria

- [x] Vue 3 project is set up with Vite
- [x] All necessary dependencies are installed and configured
- [x] Project structure is set up according to best practices
- [x] Basic routing is implemented
- [x] Pinia store is initialized
- [x] ESLint and Prettier are configured
- [x] Basic app layout is created using Vuetify components
- [x] Simple prompt management functionality is implemented

## Next Steps

The initial project setup is complete. Proceed to `02_frontendStructure.md` to continue implementing and refining the frontend structure of the application. The next steps include:

1. Implement more detailed prompt management features (edit, delete, categorize)
2. Add additional views for prompt organization and management
3. Enhance the existing Home view with more advanced functionality
4. Implement form validation for prompt input
5. Begin planning the backend API structure

These steps will be outlined in more detail in the subsequent sprint documents.
