# Sprint 2: Frontend Structure

## Objectives

- Implement the basic frontend structure
- Set up navigation between Management Area and Explorer Page
- Create reusable components for prompt management

## Tasks

### 1. Set Up Vue Router

1. [x] Initial router setup in `src/router/index.js`
2. [x] Add routes for Management Area and Explorer Page
3. [x] Implement navigation guards for the Management Area (PIN protection)

### 2. Update Base Layout

1. [x] Initial layout setup in `src/App.vue` using Vuetify
2. [x] Implement a navigation component for switching between Management Area and Explorer Page
3. [x] Add a theme toggle component to the app bar

### 3. Implement Management Area

1. [x] Create `src/views/ManagementArea.vue`
2. [x] Implement PIN entry for accessing the Management Area
3. [x] Create a basic layout for CRUD operations on prompts

### 4. Implement Explorer Page

1. [x] Create `src/views/ExplorerPage.vue`
2. [x] Implement a grid or list view for displaying all prompts
3. [x] Add filter and search functionality

### 5. Create Reusable Components

1. [x] Create `src/components/PromptCard.vue` for displaying individual prompts
2. [x] Create `src/components/PromptForm.vue` for adding/editing prompts
3. [x] Create `src/components/PromptList.vue` for displaying a list of prompts (Implemented directly in views)

### 6. Implement Theme Switching

1. [x] Create a theme toggle component
2. [x] Implement light and dark themes using Vuetify's theming system

### 7. Enhance State Management

1. [x] Initial Pinia store setup for managing prompts
2. [x] Implement actions and getters for CRUD operations on prompts
3. [x] Add state management for application settings (e.g., theme preference)

## Completion Criteria

- [x] Router is set up with proper navigation between Management Area and Explorer Page
- [x] Management Area is accessible only with correct PIN
- [x] Explorer Page displays all prompts with filter and search functionality
- [x] Reusable components are created for prompt display and management
- [x] Theme switching between light and dark modes is implemented
- [x] Enhanced state management is set up using Pinia for all CRUD operations

## Next Steps

1. [x] Implement proper authentication logic for the Management Area
2. [x] Add state management for application settings (e.g., theme preference)
3. [x] Implement data persistence (e.g., using localStorage or connecting to a backend API)
4. [x] Add form validation for the PromptForm component
5. [ ] Implement error handling and user feedback (e.g., success/error messages for CRUD operations)
6. [ ] Optimize performance (e.g., implement pagination for the Explorer Page)
7. [ ] Add unit tests for components and store

## Recent Changes and Bug Fixes

1. Fixed ExplorerPage.vue to handle cases when there are no prompts:
   - Added a message to display when no prompts are found
   - Optimized the filteredPrompts computed property to avoid errors with undefined properties

2. Updated PromptCard.vue and PromptForm.vue:
   - Removed unnecessary imports of `defineProps` and `defineEmits`
   - These are now used directly as compiler macros

3. Enhanced ManagementArea.vue:
   - Ensured proper usage of the Pinia store
   - Improved the layout and functionality of the CRUD operations

4. General improvements:
   - Ensured consistent use of Vuetify components across all views
   - Improved error handling and user feedback

5. Implemented theme persistence using localStorage

6. Added autocomplete attribute to password fields for better security and user experience

7. Improved PromptForm.vue:
   - Implemented watchers to update form data when props change
   - Added logic to reset the form after submitting a new prompt
   - Improved handling of editing existing prompts

These changes have addressed the initial errors and improved the overall stability and functionality of the application. The next sprint should focus on implementing the remaining features, improving user experience, and adding data persistence.

After completing these tasks, proceed to `03_coreFunctionality.md` to implement any remaining core functionality and polish the application.
