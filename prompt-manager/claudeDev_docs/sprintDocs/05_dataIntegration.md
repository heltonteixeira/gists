# Sprint 5: Data Integration

## Objectives

- Integrate backend API with frontend
- Implement data synchronization between local storage and server
- Enhance error handling and loading states

## Tasks

### 1. Set Up API Service

1. Create an `api` directory in the frontend `src` folder
2. Implement an API service using Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend

### 2. Update Pinia Store

1. Modify Pinia actions to use the API service for CRUD operations
2. Implement error handling for API requests in the store

### 3. Implement Data Synchronization

1. Create a synchronization service to handle data transfer between local storage and server
2. Implement a queue system for offline operations
3. Add a background sync process to handle the queue when online

### 4. Update Components

1. Modify components to use the updated Pinia store actions
2. Implement loading states for async operations
3. Add error handling and user feedback for failed operations

### 5. Implement Offline Mode

1. Use service workers to cache necessary assets and API responses
2. Implement offline detection and appropriate UI feedback
3. Ensure the app remains functional in offline mode using local storage

### 6. Enhance User Experience

1. Add toast notifications for successful operations
2. Implement optimistic UI updates for better responsiveness
3. Add a sync status indicator in the UI

### 7. Implement Data Migration

1. Create a data migration script to move data from local storage to the server
2. Implement a first-time sync process for new installations

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Backend API is fully integrated with the frontend
- [ ] Data synchronization between local storage and server is implemented
- [ ] Offline mode is functional with proper queue management
- [ ] Components are updated to handle async operations and potential errors
- [ ] User experience is enhanced with proper feedback and optimistic updates
- [ ] Data migration process is in place for moving from local-only to server-synced mode
