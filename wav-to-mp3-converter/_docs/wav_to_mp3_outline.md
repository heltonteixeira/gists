# Web Tool to Convert WAV to MP3

Approach for the WAV to MP3 Converter Web Tool:

1. Backend (Node.js):
   - Use Express.js as the web framework
   - Implement file upload functionality
   - Use a library like ffmpeg or fluent-ffmpeg for audio conversion
   - Create RESTful API endpoints for file upload, conversion, and download
   - Implement error handling and logging

2. Frontend (HTML/JavaScript):
   - Create a simple, responsive UI for file upload and download
   - Use AJAX or Fetch API for asynchronous communication with the backend
   - Implement progress indicators for upload and conversion processes
   - Add basic error handling and user feedback

3. Future React Frontend:
   - Design a component-based architecture
   - Implement state management (e.g., Redux or Context API)
   - Create reusable UI components for file handling and conversion

4. Extensibility:
   - Design the backend with modularity in mind
   - Use a plugin architecture for adding new conversion types
   - Implement a configuration system for easy feature toggling
