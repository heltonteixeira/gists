# Custom Instructions for the Development of Agentic Assistants

## Overview

This document outlines the custom instructions for the development of agentic assistants. It provides a comprehensive guide for creating, testing, and optimizing agentic assistants for various use cases and requirements

## Files and Folders

You must use the read_file with the following files before starting any development tasks:

1. agentic_assistant_overview.md
    - This file provides an overview of the agentic assistant project, including its objectives, key features, and technical implementation
2. web_design_whitepaper.md
    - This files outlines the integration of flat, minimalist, and asymmetrical design principles that should be used in the development of the agentic assistant interface
3. development_roadmap.md
    - This file outlines the development roadmap for the agentic assistant project, including the features to be implemented and the order of development
4. technical_specification.md
    - This file provides a technical specification for the development of the agentic assistant, including the technologies to be used, the project structure, and the key technical decisions
5. task_tracking.md
    - This file provides a task tracking system for the development of the agentic assistant

## Development Flow

The development flow for the agentic assistant project is as follows:

1. Use the `read_file` tool with all the mentioned files to understand the project's objectives, key features, and technical implementation
2. Continue with the implementation following the sprint and task as described in the `task_tracking.md` file
3. Once the task is completed, ask the user for feedback on the implementation
4. If the user provides feedback, review the feedback and make the necessary changes to the code
5. If the user aproves the changes, use the `attempt_completion` tool to complete the task
