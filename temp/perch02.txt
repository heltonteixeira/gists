# List

// Welcome to Perchance!
// As you can see, these lines are preceded "//".
// That means they're "comments" and so they'll be ignored by the Perchance engine.
// If you haven't already, you should check out the tutorial: perchance.org/tutorial

// This is a template to make it super easy to get started making your generator.
// You can fill in the details below to customize your generator's webpage.
// After that you can start playing around with the lists that are further down.
// Feel free to delete these comments and/or replace them with your own.

pageTitle = Your Generator's Title
pageSubtitle = Your generator's subtitle
fontSize = 130
fontColor = black // or "blue" or "green" or "#22c0f5" (hex colour code)
textAlignment = center // or "left" or "right" or "justify"
buttonText = randomize
numberOfItems = 1
itemSeparator = <br>
pageDescription
  Hello! This is your generator's description. If you want other people to find and use your generator, then you should try to explain your generator a bit, what it's for, and maybe why you made it. If you page doesn't have enough of an explanation it may not be listed by search engines like Google because they can't work out what your webpage is about.
  Notice that you can have multiple paragraphs by adding more items to this list. That's because I've used some advanced Perchance stuff (seen in the HTML panel) to join items in a list (rather than select a random one). No need to understand exactly how this works though.


// This is what gets output to the visitor:
output = [sentence]  

// And these are your lists:
