pivotal
  I fell in love with the wrong person, who dragged me into an exciting world I never knew existed. I freaked out and left them. Part of me cherishes the thrill.
  My best friend accused me of a crime I know I didn’t commit, but they have photos that prove otherwise. It showed me their true colors.
  I ended up in a literal warzone, bullets flying all around me. If it weren’t for a dangerous psychopath I befriended I’d be a corpse.   


pivotalfeeling
  Endless regret. I didn’t comport myself with any dignity or honesty. I thought I was better than that.
  Simmering rage. They know what they did, and they did it knowing what would happen.
  A miasma of confusion. I can’t square this circle. Nothing about this makes any sense and the more I think about it the worse it is.

pivotalwhy
  It never ended, I just move forward and try to put the past behind me. But when I look back, it’s right there, chugging along.
  The responsible parties died before they could be confronted about their part in it.
  The {System|State|Family} stepped in and took it all out of my hands.

haven
  Ancestral Mansion: A grand mansion passed down through generations. {Lightproof windows and doors were a more recent addition.|Secret chambers and tunnels made it more attractive, probably made by a paranoid former owner.|Extensive underground wine cellars, maybe a vanity for the old owner, but a great sleeping chamber for you.} 
  Urban Loft: A modern, high-end loft situated in the heart of the city. {UV-filtered windows were a musthive to see the city from above.|With a private elevator in case you need to leave in a hurry.|The whole place has surveillance, to to catch anyone who dares to try to sneak in.| The heart of the city is a great hunting ground.}
  Underground Bunker: A militarized, hidden retreat equipped for any threat. {The bunker's air filtration system has undergone some lethal modifications. You don't need to breathe and hopefully neither does anyone else who enters.|It contains an old command center with maps and communications equipment; radio has always been the best method of discreet communication.| Isolated, always a good deal.}
  The Old Library: A quiet refuge among dusty books. {Blends as a public space, it's a good misdirection.|So many bookshelves that no one but you could find your way in there.|It's easy to research information when it's just a few steps away.}
  Art Studio: An unconventional haven that doubles as an artist's creative space.{ Serves as a legitimate front for nocturnal activities and meetings with allies under the guise of artistry|Located in a culturally vibrant neighborhood, plenty of food.|Fake walls, movable pieces, this place is so open only you can remember all of the changes.}
  Hidden Rooftop Garden: A tranquil rooftop haven concealed through flora. {So much ivy that no light gets in or out.|Modified to collect water, have its own energy source and be sustainable. Not that you need that kind of thing, but it's always nice not to have the name of your mask on a document leading to your doorstep.}
  Abandoned Subway Station: An eerie refuge beneath the city streets.

  The Elite: You are a shadowy organization of aspiring elites, the people in the upper echelons of the corporate, political, or media worlds ambitious for places among the elites. You've discovered that some of the most powerful people in current affairs aren't people at all; they're vampires, mages, and monsters of all sorts. 
  Watchers of the Watchmen: A disturbingly large number of hunters are mentally damaged; another disturbingly large number are just stupid, careless, or simply don't care about collateral damage. They are unstable, and one mistake away from causing incredible tragedy. Some hunters even go so far as to warp their bodies and minds in the name of the Vigil, becoming as monstrous as the things they hunt. You direct your attention at other hunters, carefully policing their actions to ensure that they don't go to far in executing the hunt.
